## üìñ Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using the tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## ‚õµ Kubernetes

There is a template over at [onedr0p/flux-cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template) if you wanted to try and follow along with some of the practices I use here.

### Installation

My cluster is [k3s](https://k3s.io/) provisioned overtop bare-metal Debian Servers using the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) galaxy role [ansible-role-k3s](https://github.com/PyratLabs/ansible-role-k3s). This is a semi hyper-converged cluster, workloads and block storage are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a separate server for (NFS) file storage.

üî∏ _[Click here](./ansible/) to see my Ansible playbooks and roles._

### Core Components

- [cilium](https://cilium.io/): Internal Kubernetes networking plugin.
- [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared): Tunneling daemon that proxies traffic from the Cloudflare network to my cluster
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): Creates SSL certificates for services in my Kubernetes cluster.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically manages DNS records from my cluster in a cloud DNS provider.
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/): Ingress controller to expose HTTP traffic to pods over DNS.
- [rook](https://github.com/rook/rook): Distributed block storage for peristent storage.
- [sops](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): Managed secrets for Kubernetes, Ansible and Terraform which are commited to Git.
- [teleport](https://goteleport.com/): Manage some network resources remotely
- [tf-controller](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller): Additional Flux component used to run Terraform from within a Kubernetes cluster.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync) and [snapscheduler](https://github.com/backube/snapscheduler): Backup and recovery of persistent volume claims.

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my cluster based on the YAML manifests.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the [kubernetes/apps](./kubernetes/apps) folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations. Those Flux kustomizations will generally have a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application underneath it which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
üìÅ kubernetes      # Kubernetes cluster defined as code
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ apps          # Apps deployed into my cluster grouped by namespace (see below)
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ bootstrap     # Flux installation
‚îî‚îÄüìÅ flux          # Main Flux configuration of repository
```

### üì° Networking

| Name                  | CIDR              |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Server VLAN           | `10.0.30.0/24`    |
| Kubernetes pods       | `10.42.0.0/16`    |
| Kubernetes services   | `10.43.0.0/16`    |

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are selfhosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

| Service                                                                      | Use                                                               | Cost             |

## üåê DNS

### Home DNS

On my Vyos router I have CoreDNS deployed as a container. I have a split-dns setup so I can access certain pods on my network but not expose them to the public internet.

You can see more about this setup in my VyOS repo: [VyosConfig](https://github.com/binaryn3xus/VyosConfig)

### Public DNS

Outside the `external-dns` instance mentioned above another instance is deployed in my cluster and configure to sync DNS records to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). The only ingresses this `external-dns` instance looks at to gather DNS records to put in `Cloudflare` are ones that have an ingress class name of `external` and an ingress annotation of `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target`.
