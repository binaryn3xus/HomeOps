## üìñ Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using the tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## ‚õµ Kubernetes

### Installation

My Kubernetes cluster is deploy with [Talos](https://www.talos.dev). This is a semi-hyper-converged cluster, workloads and block storage are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a separate server with on my Synology NAS for storage for bulk file storage and backups.

### Core Components


- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller): Self-hosted Github runners.
- [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager): Creates SSL certificates for services in my cluster.
- [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium): Internal Kubernetes container networking interface.
- [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared): Enables Cloudflare secure access to certain ingresses.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically syncs ingress DNS records to a DNS provider.
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets): Managed Kubernetes secrets using [Azure Keyvault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault).
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx): Kubernetes ingress controller using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
- [rook](https://github.com/rook/rook): Distributed block storage for peristent storage.
- [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops): Managed secrets for Kubernetes and Terraform which are commited to Git.
- [spegel](https://github.com/XenitAB/spegel): Stateless cluster local OCI registry mirror.
- [teleport](https://goteleport.com/): Manage some network resources remotely
- [tf-controller](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller): Additional Flux component used to run Terraform from within a Kubernetes cluster.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync): Backup and recovery of persistent volume claims.

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my cluster based on the YAML manifests.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the [kubernetes/apps](./kubernetes/apps) folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations. Those Flux kustomizations will generally have a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application underneath it which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
üìÅ kubernetes      # Kubernetes cluster defined as code
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ apps          # Apps deployed into my cluster grouped by namespace (see below)
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ bootstrap     # Flux installation
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ flux          # Main Flux configuration of repository
‚îî‚îÄüìÅ templates      # re-useable components
```

### üì° Networking

| Name                  | CIDR              |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Server VLAN           | `10.0.30.0/24`    |
| Kubernetes pods       | `10.69.0.0/16`    |
| Kubernetes services   | `10.96.0.0/16`    |

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are selfhosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

## üåê DNS

### Home DNS

On my Vyos router I have [Bind9](https://github.com/isc-projects/bind9) and [dnsdist](https://dnsdist.org/) deployed as containers. In my cluster `external-dns` is deployed with the `RFC2136` provider which syncs DNS records to `bind9`.

Downstream DNS servers configured in `dnsdist` such as `bind9` (above) and [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/). All my clients use `dnsdist` as the upstream DNS server, this allows for more granularity with configuring DNS across my networks. These could be things like giving each of my VLANs a specific `nextdns` profile, or having all requests for my domain forward to `bind9` on certain networks, or only using `1.1.1.1` instead of `nextdns` on certain networks where adblocking isn't required.

### Public DNS

Outside the `external-dns` instance mentioned above another instance is deployed in my cluster and configured to sync DNS records to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). The only ingress this `external-dns` instance looks at to gather DNS records to put in `Cloudflare` are ones that have an ingress class name of `external` and contain an ingress annotation `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target`.
